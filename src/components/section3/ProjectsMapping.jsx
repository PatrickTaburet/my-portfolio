          <p>NexusLab is a collaborative platform focused on the fusion of art and technology. It enables users to manipulate, create, and share digital artworks generated through creative coding algorithms.</p>
          <p>By integrating artistic practices that blend programming with visual art, NexusLab aims to make these forms of expression more accessible and to build a community around these disciplines, fostering co-creation and knowledge sharing.</p>
          <p>The project, available on both web and mobile platforms, leverages modern technologies such as React, Symfony, and React Native. Its structure and technical choices ensure a seamless and secure user experience across all devices.</p>
          <p>It was developed as part of my Application Designer and Developer program (Concepteur DÃ©veloppeur d'Applications) and was presented as my final project during the certification exam.</p>
